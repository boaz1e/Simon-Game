# Simon-Game
One of everyone's favorite childhood games! an experience that enabled me to work with my JavaScript skills and idea of front-end web game design.

This game is extremely basic, and you just press any key to start the game which triggers the game mechanism that beeps one of the four colored boxes on the screen.
The beeped box goes into an array which stores the sequence of color buttons to be pressed. The user then has to copy the particular sequence and once the full sequence
has been copied another colored button gets added to that sequence making the sequence longer as each level progresses.
The user can make upto as many stages as they are able to.
I added sounds to the game upon button pressing and gameover sound when the player loses. 

Run Instructions: You can either download the files and open index.html with a browser or you can access this link to play the game online:
